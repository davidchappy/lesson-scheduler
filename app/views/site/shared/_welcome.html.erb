        <p>To encourage students’ continued progress over the summer months, we offer discounts for multiple students and higher numbers of lessons (each student is asked to take at least 7 lessons over summer to reserve a lesson spot for the fall).</p> 
        <p>This scheduling tool is optional—if students choose NOT to submit a schedule by May 31st (the deadline) they will remain on the the regular payment schedule for summer with the option to make up lessons as needed.<p>
        <p>If there are any questions about these discounts or the schedule, please contact us below and we would be glad to help!</p>
